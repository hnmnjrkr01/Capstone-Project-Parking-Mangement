# Capstone-Project-Car-Parking-Application
Capstone Project for Per-Schola

This project focuses on the development of a secure and user-friendly car parking application that streamlines the process of parking spot management. Users can easily access an "About" page to learn more about the application, create an account, view their past and upcoming bookings, and make new reservations by selecting from available parking spots. The application also allows users to provide valuable feedback through reviews, ensuring their credentials and personal information are kept secure with the integration of Spring Boot Security. For system-administrators, the application offers features to manage user accounts by altering user information when necessary, as well as the ability to create new parking spots and activate or deactivate existing ones. The goal of this system is to provide both users and administrators with a seamless, efficient, and secure parking experience.
